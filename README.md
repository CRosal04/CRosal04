# Hi there üëã

Hello! My name is Christopher Rosales Barrera, and I am currently a student at Arizona State University, pursuing a major in Graphic Information Technology with a minor in Technological Entrepreneurship and Management.


I am a *motivated and dedicated* individual who brings enthusiasm and a strong work ethic to every role I take on. My academic journey blends creative design, technical expertise, and entrepreneurial insight, equipping me with the skills to navigate and excel in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions, leveraging technology, and delivering impactful results. Whether working independently or collaborating within a team.




I am currently collaborating with a **growing trucking company** to design and refine their brand identity. **My role includes developing a distinctive and impactful logo that aligns with their vision and values, as well as designing the visual aesthetics of their fleet units.** This hands-on experience has strengthened my expertise in graphic design, branding, and practical applications of visual communication within the transportation industry.


Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me‚ÄîI look forward to connecting and sharing ideas!
